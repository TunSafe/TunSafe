2018-??-?? - TunSafe v1.4-rc2

Changes:

  is deactivated when disconnecting. Without this behavior, the 
  kill switch is unusable when auto connecting on Windows startup.

2018-08-11 - TunSafe v1.4-rc1

Changes:
1.Subfolders in the Config/ directory now show up as submenus.
2.Added a way to run TunSafe as a Windows Service.
  Foreground Mode: The service will disconnect when TunSafe closes.
  Background Mode: The service will stay connected in the background.

  the service is running.

  should not be routed through TunSafe.
4.Can now automatically start TunSafe when Windows starts
5.New UI with tabs and graphs
6.Cache DNS queries to ensure DNS will succeed if connection fails

9.Main window is now resizable

13.Delete the routes we made when disconnecting
14.Fix error message about unable to delete a route when connecting

  The route rule adds two /1 routes to 0.0.0.0.
2.Convert LF to CRLF when importing config files

  disconnecting
